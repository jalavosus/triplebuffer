# triplebuffer

`go get github.com/jalavosus/triplebuffer`

An attempt at writing a triple buffer system in Go.

There are GoDocs for all public things, a fairly extensive set of tests,
and a very basic usage example in [cmd/main.go](./cmd/main.go).

Don't use this in production without personally vetting it. Please. I beg you.
